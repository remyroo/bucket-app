# BucketApp

This is a simple bucketlist application built using Angular2.

It is powered by an API built with Django Rest Framework. You can take a look at API here: [cp3 repo](https://github.com/andela-rwachira/cp3/tree/develop)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Make sure you follow the instructions to run the [API's server](https://github.com/andela-rwachira/cp3/tree/develop) as well, otherwise this app will not be able to send/receive data.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
